py-xgboost-models.py

Will contain models from xgboost package using Python interface

Contributors will add data to appropriate folder and (concise, neat) modeling
scripts to this file. All (concise, neat) modeling scripts must create a list
with following elements:

* model name
* model description
* data name
* data description
* performance

This resulting list will be appended to the global models list at the end of
each contributors script. The results in the global models list will be
described automatically with a table and plot in the main repo README.md.
